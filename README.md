# Data-Sentinel-Azure-s-PII-Looker
Data Sentinel: Azure's PII Looker is a Streamlit application for extracting, detecting, and masking sensitive data from employee ID cards. Powered by Tesseract OCR and Azure Cognitive Services, it identifies PII like names, emails, and phone numbers, anonymizes them, and displays results in an interactive table with image previews.
